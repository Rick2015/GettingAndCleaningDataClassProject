Introduction
There are six activities captured when subject wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

  Activity Number & Activity Labels
  --------------------
	1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING


Every row in the Test and Train data set is a 128 element vector.
-----------------------------------------
- 3-axial raw signals, prefix 't' to denote time                         
   (tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ)

- Acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
   (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 

- Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
   (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ)

- 3D signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
   (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag)

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
   (fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag)

- Others
   (tBodyGyro-XYZ,fBodyAccMag)

- Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
   (gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean)

Processed data: 
  Assignment was to output a subset of the combined Test & Train data set based on mean and standard (std) measurements.
  This subset was then grouped by Activity and Subject (group_by) and then averaged (summarise_each).

Output:
  Combined Test & Train data sets: XTrainTest - 10299 obs. of  564 variables
  Subset of Combined data set: XTrainTestSub - 10299 obs. of  82 variables
  Summarized results of Grouping & Averaging: DF - 180 obs of  82 variables
